Steps followed by me:

1. Built common components: Button,Input
2. Built TextActionsItem component in which we have single text nd the action makers. All the text styling actions are implemented in this component. Again on broad this is the common component
3. All Four TextActionsItem components are wrapped in TextActions Component.
